I am currently a PhD student in Computational Biology at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, UNSW. My research focus is computational modelling of biological systems through the lens of both mechanistic foundations (Cell, 2023), and supervised machine learning methods (Bioinformatics, 2023).

More broadly, I am interested in gene regulatory networks, stochastic gene expression, and the exploration of biological systems at multiple scales, including for synthetic biology applications. These phenomena are fundamentally unintuitive and, in my view, necessitate the application of computational methods.
